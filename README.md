# TrainSchedule

This application displays a board of train times and uses momentjs to calculate arrival times and minutes-until-arrival of the next train on every given line. Users can delete a train from view, or edit the details displayed, for each train.

Users can also add a train to the board, where it will display as part of the database -- provided that they enter all fields of the simple form.
